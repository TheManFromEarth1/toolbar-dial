# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial requires no configuration. Bookmarks in the "Bookmarks Toolbar" folder will be shown in a grid that is similar to the Speed Dial in Opera browser. Rather than displaying a thumbnail generated from the bookmarked page, Toolbar Dial will display a colored box with the domain name.

The ability to generate thumbnails will be added in a future update.

## No Configuration

Place bookmarks that you would like to be shown in the Toolbar Dial grid in the "Bookmarks Toolbar" folder. Bookmarks in the "Bookmarks Toolbar" folder will be show in the same order they are in the folder. To change the order of bookmarks in the Toolbar Dial grid, reararnge the order of bookmarks in the "Bookmarks Toolbar" folder.

Nested folders are not displayed, but will be added in a future update.
